      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>We're a software and hardware company that develops smart technology for everyday items. Here at NextGen Sens,
        our main goal is to make everyday life easier for everyone.
        We achieve this by deveolping softawre and creating hardware that adds functionaly to frequntly used items.
        Smartridge is the only product we sell as of right now but it's
        an example of how we plan to revolutionise modern-day life. Our SmartRidge software tracks what's in your
        fridge, helps you cook and come up with recipes and even has a
        built-in virtual assistant. You can access all this information through the app or the screen built into the
        fridge. The software gets information via very precise cameras and sensors.
        All our products are sold to companies such as Samsung and LG who then implement both the software and hardware
        into their products. We also sell directly to customers
        if they want to upgrade a current product they have such as their old fridge.</p>
      <p>NextGen Sens all started with 5 people who were looking for a way to change the way we live. With so much smart
        technology nowadays we just thought that there were too many
        items that were being held behind. We had smartphones and smart TVs but we didn't have anything like smart
        fridges. It's with that in mind that we created NextGen Sens.</p>
